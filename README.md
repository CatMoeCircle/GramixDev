### Developer's Note
I wanted a Telegram third-party client with an interface that matches my vision, but due to my limited capabilities, I can only start with basic functionality and build it up gradually. With only basic experience in Vue development, many aspects are not following standardized development processes. Additionally, my lack of deep JavaScript knowledge makes this quite challenging. I've also never worked with chat service interactions before, so many aspects are under-considered. Therefore, I've used AI to assist in development. If there are any issues or mistakes in the code or if something hasn't been considered, please feel free to open issues to correct them. Contributors are welcome to help maintain this project and include as many features from the original client as possible, as well as correct errors in the code.

### Open Source
The entire project will be released with the first test version, which is expected to support only basic text chatting and may not support Telegram's native language packs (as all UI text is currently hard-coded in the code; voice packs are a priority for future adaptation).
